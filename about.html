    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <article>
      <section>
				<div>
					<p>The school is a distinctive Christian institution founded upon Christian principles on September
						17<sup>th</sup>, 2005 at Grafton Village and was the first private school within that community then.
						The school started with 14 pupils, from Nursery to Prep three(3), and it kept growing from
						the inception up to 2008 when the first set of prep six(6) pupils took the National Primary
						School Examination (NPSE) and <strong>got 100% pass</strong>. <em>Based on the outcome of the NPSE result,
						parents expressed the need for the introduction of High school.</em></p>
				</div>

 <!-- This gave birth to the
establishment of the Dynamic International High school, which was commissioned in May,
2008 and started its full operation in September of the same year when classes commenced
at 42 Water Street, Congo town with eight pupils enrolled. -->
			<div>
				<p>The enrolment gradually increased from eight(8) to twenty seven(27) pupils by the end of that academic year.
					Since the commencement of the High school, tremendous progresses were made, that led to
					numerical growth and public recognition.
					However in 2011, fifteen Pupils from the school were registered under a public school to take the
					Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) <strong>and all of them got six subjects and above</strong>.</p>
			</div>
 <!-- In its development strive, the school was relocated at 26 Banana Water Drive, Off
Murray Town Road owing to its numerical growth and the desire to provide a better learning
environment in January 2012. -->

			<div>
				<p>In 2012, both the Junior and Senior schools got provisional approval with codes to take both the
					Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) and the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).
					The activities and outcomes of the school since 2012, have proved that Dynamic International High School (DIHS)
					is one of the best schools in our country.</p>
			</div>

			With a well furnished computer laboratory,
outstanding results in public examinations, as well as child centred educational activities that
practically develop the three domains of every child who passes through the school, the
need for excellence is always sought to promote standard. As an established institution, we
could boast of astronomical successes over the years, as most of our former pupils of this
institution are found in recognized universities and colleges in and out of Sierra Leone.
However, the school met one of its greatest challenges during the Ebola crises in our country
and it resulted in financial hardship in the payment of staff, our yearly rents, payment of bills
and other running costs. This eventually led to the loss of the building we were occupying at
26 Banana water Drive, Off Murray Town Road, and this subsequently led to a drastic drop in
the enrolment, damaged of properties, withdrawer of some staff followed by some other
unexpected effects.
